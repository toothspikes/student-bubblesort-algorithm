This was for a midterm exam in my Programming Fundamentals III course in Fall 2024.

The program takes user input for an x amount of students and the names of the students.
It creates a vector of Student objects that contain randomly generated GPA, ID, and Age.
GPA is a number between 0 and 4.0 ; ID is a 4 digit number ; Age is between 20-32.
Student class is a child class to Person class, which had no objects created for it in this program.
